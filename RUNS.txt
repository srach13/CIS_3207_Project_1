For my data, I decided to choose reasonable, simple values that replicate the times it takes
to process events. For example, I chose QUIT_PROB and NET_PROB to be 0.3. This means that 70% of the time,
a job leaving the CPU will not quit, and 70% of the time, it will do disk I/0. For the rest of my values,
I chose numbers in a similar range. For example, my values for DISK1_MIN and DISK1_MAX fall in the same
interval as DISK2_MIN and DISK2_MAX. I did this to keep the values consistent and so it more closely
resembles an actual simulation.
